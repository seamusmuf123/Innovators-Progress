Part 2: Elevator Pitch of Project/Product
Remember to address the questions in the Phase 1 Requirements document.
We are building Progress, a data-driven personal fitness app designed to help users stay consistent, motivated,
and goal-oriented in their fitness journey. The app empowers individuals by allowing them to log their
workouts, track routines, and visually monitor their progress over time—all connected back to their personal
fitness goals. Whether someone is aiming for muscle gain, fat loss, or improved endurance, Progress gives users
a structured and motivating way to see how far they've come and where they’re headed.
Unlike existing fitness apps that rely on generic plans and minimal feedback, Progress addresses the pain point
of inconsistent tracking and lack of visual accountability. By collecting detailed workout and body data and
analyzing it over time, our app supports users who want to see measurable improvements in both form and
function. Our core user personas include people striving for specific physical results, those struggling with
consistency, and visual learners who need to see their growth to stay motivated. Key features include a dynamic
progress visualizer, personalized goal setting and tracking, and a routine library that adapts based on user input
and results.
Part 3: User Personas
Persona 1: Maya Johnson
What’s Their Story:
Maya is a 27 year old marketing associate. Her fitness goal is to lose 10 pounds and gain lean
muscle. She’s fairly comfortable with using mobile apps and tracking devices like her watch. But
there’s only so much visual tracker of her activity on a screen that small. Visual progress is crucial to
her consistency.
User Stories for Persona 1:
1. As a user I need to be able to know what’s available for me to use at the gym.
2. As a user I need weekly reminders to stay consistent with my workouts.
3. As a user I need routine planning that aligns with my fitness goals.
4. As a user I need to be able to set goals that push me to the extent.

any irregular behavior.
5. As a user, I want access to user accounts that have memberships to know which ones are
inactive or not.

Queries for User Stories
For each of your user stories, provide a single SQL SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement
that would solve the data needs of the user story. Label each Query with its corresponding User
Story Number (e.g., “2.4” for user story 4 of persona #2, or something similar). Each SQL statement
should be written to work with your data model.
The SQL Statements provided should be formatted appropriately and in a fixed-point font such as
Courier or Fira Mono.
